# own-redis

## Learning Objectives

- TCP/IP
- UDP protocol
- Basic networking concepts

## Abstract

In this project, you will build a custom key-value database.

Such databases are crucial for efficiently storing and retrieving data using unique keys. This application will operate in RAM for fast access, utilizing the UDP protocol to facilitate communication between the storage and the client. Key operations will include SET, GET, and PING.

This project will enhance your understanding of networking and database principles.
