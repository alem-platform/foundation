## Abstract

In this project, you will build a **CLI application â€” an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed aggregator**, which:

- Provides a command-line interface (CLI)
- Fetches and parses [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feeds
- Stores articles in PostgreSQL
- Aggregates RSS feeds using a worker pool in the background

This is a service that collects publications from various sources that provide RSS feeds (news sites, blogs, forums). It helps users stay informed in one place without the need to visit each website manually.

Such a tool is useful for journalists, researchers, analysts, and anyone who wants to stay updated on topics of interest without unnecessary noise. This kind of application makes information more accessible and centralized.
